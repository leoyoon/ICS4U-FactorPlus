//  The "Application Help" screen. One of two help screens.
//  Linked from the HelpEntranceViewController view controller.
//
//  HelpViewController is a controller with one main function: To display a collection view with images that show the functionality of some screens that seem ambiguous.
//  To do this, the application help images are put into an array, which will be used to declare the cells in the collection view

import UIKit

class HelpViewController: UIViewController, UICollectionViewDataSource, UICollectionViewDelegate {
//  Just like the MainViewController, the HelpViewController is given the properties of UICollectionViewDataSource and UICollectionViewDelegate, so that the collection view object can be modified by the data from this code
//  The functions of UIScrollViewDelegate are not implemented in this class, and therefore UIScrollViewDelegate is not called
//  All of the scrolling and locking mechanisms for the collection view in HelpViewController is one of the system defaults that can be modified in the storyboard

//  viewDidLoad is activated when the view first loads
//  viewDidLoad is a system default
//  In this particular class, the viewDidLoad method has no use
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        
        super.viewDidLoad()

    func collectionView(collectionView: UICollectionView, numberOfItemsInSection section: Int) -> Int {

    func collectionView(collectionView: UICollectionView, cellForItemAtIndexPath indexPath: NSIndexPath) -> UICollectionViewCell {
        
        //This function declares a cell object with the properties of HelpCollectionViewCell class
    
        let cell = collectionView.dequeueReusableCellWithReuseIdentifier("Help Cell", forIndexPath: indexPath) as! HelpCollectionViewCell
