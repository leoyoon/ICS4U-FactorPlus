//  The following code is an algorithm that accepts a, h, and k values from a graphing class
//  The a, h and k values are used to create an equation which is then termed the "right answer"
//  Afterwards, 3 randomly generated multiple choice equations, some similar, some completely different are all placed in an
//  array with 4 elements
//  The "right answer" is then inserted randomly into the array at an index which is recorded as "right index"
//  This forms the base of the graphing multiple choice game mode, where the MCG view controller takes the "multiple choice" 
//  answer array and the index of the array which holds the correct answer to determine whether the user has pressed the
//  correct button
//
//  CODE ANAYLSIS (Read after understanding the way it functions)
//
//  This algorithm has proven to be quite efficient in terms of run time as there is barely any delay between the questions in the
//  graphing multiple choice gamemode
//  It is a relatively simplified algorithm that takes 5 big steps (highlighted above) with a maximum of 3 increments in the longest for
//  loop
//  
//  Areas of inefficiency include: 
//
//  The Checking portion: Could be removed because the multiple choice answers can probably be generated in a way that won't produce
//  repeating answers
//  
//  The randomTypeOfAns portion: Doesn't generate consistent multiple choice answers. Most of the time, the answers are reasonably
//  difficult, but sometimes, the right answer may be too obvious.
//
//  The random number generators that create values for a, h and k for the multiple choice answers: Sometimes they may generate the
//  correct a, h and k values that are present in finalAns. This will be an issue when implementing an adaptive difficulty setting
