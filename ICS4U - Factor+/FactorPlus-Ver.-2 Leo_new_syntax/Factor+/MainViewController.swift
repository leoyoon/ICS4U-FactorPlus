//MainViewController class is the first view controller that is shown when the app opens
//The main function of this class is to enable the user to navigate to different options by the items (cells) in the collectionView object
//To do so, functions that initilize, specialize (give a specific image to each item (cell), cause a specific action to take place when the item (cell) is clicked), and give functionality to the item (cell) objects
//Some additional functions for esthetics are coded along with the decloration of the cells in the collectionView, which are implemented for a better appeal to the user
//To do so, UIScrollView is delegated into MainViewController
//This allows for fixing the items in the collectionView according to the scroll index, moving to the middle item when the view controller loads, as well as the access to the scroll position of the collectionView
